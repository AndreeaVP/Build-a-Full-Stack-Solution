# Project: Build a full stack solution
# Groupomania 
Groupomania is an internal social network for Groupomania's employees. The goal of this tool is to facilitate more interaction between colleagues. A file with the company's logos has been provided. As well as the user requirements specifications.
The design was free of choice. 
The backend has been developed using Express. The data is stored on a SQL Database. The frontend of the app was developed with Vue.js.

1. Node.js version 18.16.0
1. MySql version 8.0.34 
1. Vue.js @vue/cli 5.0.8
## Backend installation
Once the repository is cloned, go to the backend directory and run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies and devDependencies needed for the backend server.
### Usage
